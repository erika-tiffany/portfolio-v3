/**
 * Here we are going to set the box-sizing to border-box which seems more 
 * intuitive. The border and padding values will be moved inside the element's  * box, cutting into the width/height of the box rather than expanding it. 
 * Therefore an elements width includes element width + border + padding.
 *
 * Universal Box Sizing with Inheritance
 *
 * This reset gives you more flexibility as you can use content-box or 
 * padding-box (where supported) at will, without worrying about a universal 
 * selector overriding our CSS.
